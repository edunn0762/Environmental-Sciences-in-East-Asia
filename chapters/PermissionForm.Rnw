Thus, the text you have written could be revised in the future, should you give permission. For example, I'd like to add a glossary and an index of topics -- more than we had time to do. I should also fix citation issues at some point. 

I have purposely given you the option after grades were submitted to ensure that how you proceed will have no bearing on the your course outcome.

However, you may appreciate others going over and possibly improving your text with time and adding their names as contributors or co-authors iftheWhether or not you decide to give permission has no bearing on your grade.
