	abstract = {This cross-sectional study was intended to examine health effects of 678 male workers
employed during an 8-yr period from 2000 to 2007 at 36 municipal and private waste
incineration plants in Japan. Blood samples were obtained for analysis of concentrations
of dioxins including coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (coplanar PCBs) and evaluation of
health effects. Health effects including diabetes were surveyed via a physician’s
interview or clinical data from blood samples. There was a certain difference in serum
concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) between the incinerator workers
and Japanese general population, although no differences in the concentrations of total
dioxins or polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) were found between the two groups. A
few positive correlations between serum levels of PCDDs and PCDFs and the results of
laboratory and physiological tests were found, but coplanar PCBs showed significant
relations with 14 parameters of the tests. The background serum levels of PCDDs, PCDFs and
total dioxins were significantly associated with the prevalence of diabetes. No essential
differences in serum concentrations of total dioxins and in prevalence of diabetes between
our subjects and the general population suggested that the incinerator workers were
marginally exposed to dioxins in the workplace without any recognizable adverse health
effects.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.envpol.2018.10.111},
	abstract = {The numerical and mass concentrations of microplastics collected at 36 sites on the surfaces of 29 Japanese rivers were mapped and compared with four basin characteristics (basin area, population density, and urban and agricultural ratios) and six water quality parameters (pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (T-N), and total phosphorus (T-P)) in each river basin. Microplastics were found in 31 of the 36 sites, indicating that some plastics fragment into small pieces before reaching the ocean. The microplastic concentrations are significantly correlated with urbanisation and population density, indicating that the microplastic concentrations in the river depend on human activities in the river basin. Furthermore, we found a significant relationship between the numerical and mass concentrations and BOD, which is an environmental indicator of river pollution. This result demonstrates that microplastic pollution in river environments has progressed more in polluted rivers with poor water quality than in rivers with good water quality, leading to the conclusion that the sources and inflow processes of microplastics in river environments are similar to those of other pollutants. Our findings can help identify potential sources (i.e., point and non-point sources) of fragmented microplastics to improve waste management in Japan and model the transport fluxes of fragmented microplastics in Japanese rivers using water quality parameters and basin characteristics.},
